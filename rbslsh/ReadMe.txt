
#### LSH in C++  -  Some code thinking borrows from the cylinderCodeApp and LSHBOX
  
  * matrix.h defines a Dataset management class 
     - put the data from the file into a Matrix in memory
	 
  * rbslsh.h defines the LSH implementation

  * rbslsh.cpp is used to test the function 
     - work in Windows platform now
