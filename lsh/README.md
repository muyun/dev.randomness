##### The Privacy-preserving search in Hamming Space based on LSH
   
   *  test on the simulation dataset
   
   *  ANNMain_single.m gives the first n (or less) appr. nearest neighbours of query q according to the collision count
   
        - sort with the estimated hamming distance?
   
   *  ANNMain_simu_data.m gives the indexing performance result (result.fig)
   
   *  lsh.m is the LSH alg implementation
