  
### Randomness as a source of efficiency
    Using randomization one can gain phenomenally in the efficiency by paying a very small price in reliability.
    A fast randomized algorithm can be more reliable than a slow deterministic algorithms.
    
### kNN
    Find k Near Neighbors in hamming distance without evaluating the actual value of this hamming distance.
    The above Randomness alg is used.
