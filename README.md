  
#### Randomness as a source of efficiency
    * Using randomization one can gain phenomenally in the efficiency by paying a very small price in reliability.
    * A fast randomized algorithm can be more reliable than a slow deterministic algorithms.
 
#### lsh
    * LSH based on Random Bits Sampling

#### kNN
    * Find k Near Neighbors in hamming distance without evaluating the actual value of this hamming distance.
    * The above Randomness alg is used.
